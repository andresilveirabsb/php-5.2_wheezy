Description: Fast, stable PHP opcode cacher
 XCache is a fast, stable PHP opcode cacher that has been tested and
 is now running on production servers under high load.  It overcomes a
 lot of problems that has been with other competing opcachers such as
 being able to be used with new PHP versions.

 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly.
